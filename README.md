# Product Case Studies

This repository is a curated portfolio of product‑oriented work.  
My background is in data science, and these case studies show how I use user understanding, structured processes, and data to build and improve products.

Each case study includes:  
- **Product view:** problem, users, decisions, trade‑offs, roadmap, and outcomes  
- **Technical view:** links to code, architecture, and implementation details

## 1. InfosecDecompress Podcast (0 to 1 product)

Mandarin cybersecurity education product from idea to a top 1.5% global ranking, later selected by Taiwan Academia Sinica for internal training.

I co‑created a 2‑person show that turned an underserved need (“I want to understand security, but everything is too technical or too shallow”) into a data‑informed content product with a clear pipeline, roadmap, and growth strategy.

**From a product perspective:**
- 0 to 1: identified an underserved audience and defined the show’s positioning and promise  
- Discovery: validated that Mandarin‑speaking beginners needed approachable security content  
- Content roadmap: chose topics, formats, and guests based on user needs and data  
- Metrics and iteration: used Spotify/Apple data and listener feedback to refine topics and formats  
- Go‑to‑market: distribution, Instagram campaigns, partnerships, and basic branding

## 2. COVID Analytics Automation

End‑to‑end COVID data product for internal decision makers, partners, and public dashboards.

During the pandemic, I owned analytics product design and implementation for an automated reporting system that replaced manual spreadsheet work with a reliable data product teams used every day.

**From a product perspective:**
- Problem framing: from “automate reports” to “design a reporting experience that is fast, consistent, and scalable”  
- User research: shadowed epidemiologists, talked to operations staff, understood public and partner needs  
- MVP and prioritization: scoped the first version around core metrics and three key data sources, then iterated  
- Stakeholder management: aligned operations, engineering, executives, and public health experts  
- Impact: cut report time from 3–4 hours to about 15 minutes and supported 100K+ daily users

## 3. Scratch Jr Programming Course (in progress)

Mandarin programming course for kids, turning a validated classroom class into a structured online curriculum.

Starting from a successful in‑person Scratch Jr course for 5–7 year‑olds, I co‑designed the online version with the instructor, focusing on curriculum architecture, motivation systems, and parent experience.

**From a product perspective:**
- Curriculum design: introduce sequence, conditional logic, and loops through stories and games for a very young audience  
- Motivation systems: badges, points, and parent‑defined rewards to keep kids engaged in a self‑paced format  
- Parent experience: simple guides, checklists, and progress records so parents can see and support what their child is learning  
- Productization: turning a one‑teacher class into short online lessons with videos, project files, and prompts that families can run at home

## How I Work

- Start from user problems and decision needs, not just data or features  
- Use simple, testable versions to learn fast before scaling up  
- Let metrics and real usage guide what to improve next  
- Communicate clearly with both technical and non‑technical stakeholders
