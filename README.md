# Chia Chang – Product and Analytics Portfolio

This repository is a curated portfolio for product‑oriented work.  
My background is in data science, and these case studies show how I use data, user understanding, and iteration to build and improve products.

- Product view: problem, users, decisions, trade‑offs, and impact  
- Technical view: code, data, and implementation details


## 1. COVID Analytics Automation  
End‑to‑end COVID data product for internal decision makers and public dashboards

During the pandemic, I helped build an automated reporting system that powered internal reports, research collaborations, and public dashboards. The goal was to replace manual spreadsheet work with a reliable data product that teams could depend on every day.

**What this shows from a product perspective**
- Problem framing: from “automate reports” to “design a reporting experience that is fast, consistent, and scalable”  
- User research: shadowing epidemiologists, talking to operations staff, and understanding public and partner needs  
- MVP and prioritization: scoping the first version around a few core metrics and three key data sources, then iterating  
- Stakeholder management: aligning operations, engineering, executives, and public health experts  
- Impact: cutting report time from 3–4 hours to about 15 minutes and supporting 100k+ daily users

## 2. InfosecDecompress Podcast (0 to 1 product)  
Mandarin cybersecurity education product from idea to top 2% global show

Together with a co‑host I launched the first Mandarin cybersecurity podcast and grew it from zero to a top 2% show in its category. We treated it as a full product, not just a content hobby.
Taiwan Academia Sinica proactively sought out and selected our content for their internal cybersecurity training.

**What this shows from a product perspective**
- 0 to 1: identifying an underserved audience and building a new product from scratch  
- Discovery: validating that Mandarin‑speaking professionals needed approachable security content  
- Content and feature roadmap: choosing topics, formats, and guests to serve a clear user problem  
- Metrics and iteration: using download trends, completion rates, and listener feedback to refine positioning  
- Go‑to‑market: distribution, basic branding, and partnerships for training and internal workshops

## 3. Business Analytics Scenarios (Olist)  
Decision support for operations, marketing, and customer teams

This project uses a 100k+ order e‑commerce dataset to simulate realistic stakeholder questions: delivery performance, late orders, high‑value customers, city revenue, and campaign impact.

**What this shows from a product perspective**
- Translating vague questions into concrete, answerable problem statements  
- Designing slices of analysis around real teams: operations, customer service, marketing, regional sales  
- Choosing the right level of detail based on urgency, audience, and whether the question will recur  
- Turning raw SQL results into recommendations that connect back to business decisions

## How I like to work

- Start from user problems and decision needs, not just data or features  
- Use simple, testable MVPs to learn fast before scaling up  
- Let metrics and real usage guide what to improve next  
- Communicate clearly with both technical and non‑technical stakeholders
