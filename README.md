# Product Case Studies

This portfolio shows how I approach problems from a product perspective.

My background is data science, but these projects required more than technical execution. They needed user research, prioritization, iteration, and measuring impact—the core of product work.

Each case study includes:
- Product view: problem, users, decisions, trade-offs, and outcomes
- Technical view: links to code and implementation details



## 1. InfosecDecompress Podcast (0 to 1 product)

Mandarin cybersecurity education product from idea to top 1.5% global ranking.

My co-host and I launched the first accessible Mandarin cybersecurity podcast and grew it from zero to a show used by Taiwan Academia Sinica for internal training.

**From a product perspective:**
- 0 to 1: identified an underserved audience and built from scratch
- Discovery: validated that Mandarin-speaking professionals needed approachable security content
- Content roadmap: chose topics, formats, and guests to serve a clear user need
- Metrics and iteration: used download trends, completion rates, and listener feedback to refine positioning
- Go-to-market: distribution, partnerships, and basic branding

## 2. COVID Analytics Automation

End-to-end COVID data product for internal decision makers and public dashboards.

During the pandemic, I built an automated reporting system that replaced manual spreadsheet work with a reliable data product teams could depend on daily.

**From a product perspective:**
- Problem framing: from "automate reports" to "design a reporting experience that is fast, consistent, and scalable"
- User research: shadowed epidemiologists, talked to operations staff, understood public and partner needs
- MVP and prioritization: scoped first version around core metrics and three key data sources, then iterated
- Stakeholder management: aligned operations, engineering, executives, and public health experts
- Impact: cut report time from 3-4 hours to about 15 minutes, supported 100K+ daily users

## 3. Scratch Jr Programming Course (in progress)

Mandarin programming course for kids, from validated classroom format to online curriculum.

Started from a tested in-person Scratch Jr course for 5-7 year-olds, now turning it into an online, modular product.

**From a product perspective:**
- Curriculum design: sequence, conditional logic, and loops through stories and games for a very young audience
- Motivation systems: badges, points, and parent-defined rewards to keep kids engaged across 16 weeks
- Parent experience: simple guides, checklists, and progress records so parents can see what their child is learning
- Productization: breaking a live class into short online lessons with videos, project files, and prompts that can be run at home

## How I Work

- Start from user problems and decision needs, not just data or features
- Use simple, testable versions to learn fast before scaling up
- Let metrics and real usage guide what to improve next
- Communicate clearly with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
