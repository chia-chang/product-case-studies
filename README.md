# Product Case Studies

This repository is a curated portfolio for product‑oriented work.  
My background is in data science, and these case studies show how I use data, user understanding, and iteration to build and improve products.

- Product view: problem, users, decisions, trade‑offs, and impact  
- Technical view: code, data, and implementation details


## 1. InfosecDecompress Podcast (0 to 1 product)  
Mandarin cybersecurity education product from idea to top 1.5% global show

Together with a co‑host I launched the first Mandarin cybersecurity podcast and grew it from zero to a top 1.5% show in its category. We treated it as a full product, not just a content hobby.
Taiwan Academia Sinica proactively sought out and selected our content for their internal cybersecurity training.

**From a product perspective**
- 0 to 1: identifying an underserved audience and building a new product from scratch  
- Discovery: validating that Mandarin‑speaking professionals needed approachable security content  
- Content and feature roadmap: choosing topics, formats, and guests to serve a clear user problem  
- Metrics and iteration: using download trends, completion rates, and listener feedback to refine positioning  
- Go‑to‑market: distribution, basic branding, and partnerships for training and internal workshops

Code and infrastructure for the podcast website live in a shared [GitHub organization](https://github.com/Infosecdecompress), where I collaborate with my co‑host on the site and related tooling.


## 2. COVID Analytics Automation  
End‑to‑end COVID data product for internal decision makers and public dashboards

During the pandemic, I helped build an automated reporting system that powered internal reports, research collaborations, and public dashboards. The goal was to replace manual spreadsheet work with a reliable data product that teams could depend on every day.

**From a product perspective**
- Problem framing: from “automate reports” to “design a reporting experience that is fast, consistent, and scalable”  
- User research: shadowing epidemiologists, talking to operations staff, and understanding public and partner needs  
- MVP and prioritization: scoping the first version around a few core metrics and three key data sources, then iterating  
- Stakeholder management: aligning operations, engineering, executives, and public health experts  
- Impact: cutting report time from 3–4 hours to about 15 minutes and supporting 100k+ daily users

## 3. Scratch Jr Programming Course (in‑person to online, in progress)  
Mandarin programming course for kids, from validated classroom format to online curriculum

Started from a tested in‑person Scratch Jr course for 5–7 year‑olds, then began turning it into an online, modular product.

**From a product perspective**
- Curriculum and experience design for a very young audience (sequence, conditional logic, loops through stories and games)  
- Motivation systems: badges, points, and parent‑defined rewards to keep kids engaged across a 16‑week program  
- Parent experience: simple guides, checklists, and progress records so parents can see what their child is learning  
- Productization: breaking a live class into short online lessons with videos, project files, and prompts that can be run at home

## How I like to work

- Start from user problems and decision needs, not just data or features  
- Use simple, testable MVPs to learn fast before scaling up  
- Let metrics and real usage guide what to improve next  
- Communicate clearly with both technical and non‑technical stakeholders
