# Scratch Jr Programming Course: From Classroom to Online Curriculum

**Role**: Curriculum and product co‑designer  
**Project**: Mandarin Scratch Jr programming course for kids (ages 5–7)  
**Why this matters for PM**: Combines curriculum design, motivation systems, and parent experience to turn a one‑teacher class into a scalable learning product.
**What I did**: Co‑designed curriculum and structure, focused on course architecture, motivation system, and parent experience

## 1. Context and Problem

Many parents want their kids to “learn programming”, but most materials are either:

- Too abstract and text‑heavy for 5–7 year‑olds  
- No clear learning path or sense of progress

My collaborator, an experienced children’s coding teacher, had a successful in‑person Scratch Jr class. The challenge was to turn that experience into a clear curriculum that could later be delivered online, while keeping kids engaged and giving parents visibility into what their child is learning.



## 2. Mission and Target Audience

### Mission  
Help young children build confidence with programming concepts through stories, animations, and games, not through syntax or exams.

### Target audience  
- Kids aged 5–7 (extendable up to 10) with no prior coding experience  
- Parents who want something structured and playful, and who often stay involved as learning partners



## 3. Classroom Course Design (Offline MVP)

Before thinking about scaling, we designed and ran the class as a structured, in‑person course.

**Format**  
- 16 weekly classes, 1 hour each  
- Every class ends with a concrete project (an animation or mini‑game) kids can present to their parents 
- Language of instruction and materials: Mandarin

**Core learning concepts**  
- Sequence: ordering actions so characters move as expected  
- Conditional logic: reacting to events and simple choices  
- Loops: repeating patterns without copying blocks

**Motivation and rewards**  
- Point system:
  - Completing a class = 1 point  
  - Earning a badge = 2 points  
  - Creating an extra project = 1 point
- Parents define rewards that fit their family (extra iPad time, small toy, special outing), so points translate into real‑world motivation without a one‑size‑fits‑all prize list.

**Badges**  
- Basic badges for firsts (first class, first extra project, finishing a chapter).  
- Progress badges for consistency (for example, learning for several weeks in a row).  
- Special badges for extra effort (solving a hard bug, designing a full story, teaching someone else a concept).

The combination of projects, points, and badges helps kids see progress even if they cannot yet read a syllabus.



## 4. Parent Experience

Parents are a critical part of this product, so we designed for them as users too.

- A parent guide that explains the course goals, key concepts, and how they can encourage their child.  
- Simple checklists of skills for each unit (for example “open/close the app”, “ recognise the stage”, “can run a script”).  
- A progress record and project log, so parents can see what their child has built over time and have something concrete to talk about after class.  
- Clear class information in Mandarin (schedules, dates, location, price, what to bring) in a single place.

This reduces friction at signup and helps parents feel the course is structured, not just “fun screen time”.



## 5. Moving Toward an Online Curriculum (In Progress)

With the classroom version validated, the current work is to turn it into an online, modular course.

Key design decisions:

- Break the 16‑week structure into short, focused lessons that can be watched and completed at home.  
- Package each unit with:
  - A short video  
  - A Scratch Jr project file (`.sjr`)  
  - Guidelines for parents
- Preserve the point and badge system in a way that parents can run themselves (for example, printable or digital badge sheets).  
- Provide simple instructions and checklists for parents so they can guide their child even without a technical background.

The goal is to keep the playful, high‑touch feeling of the original class while making it easier for families to access on their own schedule.



## 6. Why This Matters for Product Roles

This project shows:

- Designing for a very different user group (5–7 year‑olds and their parents) compared to typical B2B data products.  
- Building an offline MVP first, learning from real classrooms, then planning how to scale it online.  
- Thinking about motivation systems, user journeys, and multi‑stakeholder needs (kids, parents, teacher) in a structured way.

## 7. Outcomes and early signals

- Successfully ran multiple 16‑week classes with consistent attendance and high project completion rates.  
- Parents reported that the badge and points system helped kids stay motivated over the whole term.  
- The offline course now provides a tested curriculum and structure for the in‑progress online version.


It complements the InfosecDecompress podcast by showing similar product thinking—just applied to early‑childhood programming instead of adult cybersecurity.
