# Scratch Jr Programming Course: From Classroom to Online Curriculum

**Role**: Curriculum and product co‑designer. Co‑designed curriculum and structure, focused on course architecture, motivation system, and parent experience.  
**Project**: Mandarin Scratch Jr programming course for kids (ages 5–7)  
**Why this matters for PM**: Combines curriculum design, motivation systems, and parent experience to turn a one‑teacher class into a scalable learning product.  

## 1. Context and Problem

Many parents want their kids to “learn programming”, but most materials are either:

- Too abstract and text‑heavy for 5–7 year‑olds  
- Lacking a clear learning path or sense of progress

My collaborator, an experienced children’s coding teacher, had a successful in‑person Scratch Jr class. The challenge was to turn that experience into a clear curriculum that could later be delivered online, while keeping kids engaged and giving parents visibility into what their child is learning.

## 2. Mission and Target Audience

### Mission

Help young children build confidence with programming concepts through stories, animations, and games, not through syntax or exams.

### Target audience

- Kids aged 5–7 (extendable up to 10) with no prior coding experience  
- Parents who want something structured and playful, and who often stay involved as learning partners

## 3. Goals and Success Metrics

For the in‑person course, success was defined on two levels:

- Kids: stay engaged across all 16 sessions, complete most projects, and feel proud when they earn badges.  
- Parents: clearly understand what their child is learning and see visible progress over time.

To track this, we looked at attendance, project completion, badge progress, and short parent feedback after class, instead of only counting sign‑ups or social media interest.

## 4. My Approach and Role

I worked as a curriculum and product co‑designer alongside the lead instructor. My approach was to:

- Treat kids and parents as distinct but connected users, observing classes and talking with parents about what worked or felt confusing.  
- Start with an offline MVP, then translate what consistently worked into a modular structure that could later be delivered online.  
- Design a simple motivation system (points and badges) that parents could adapt to their own family rules, rather than enforcing a single reward scheme.

## 5. Classroom Course Design (Offline MVP)

Before thinking about scaling, we designed and ran the class as a structured, in‑person course.

### Format

- 16 weekly classes, 1 hour each  
- Every class ends with a concrete project (an animation or mini‑game) kids can present to their parents  
- Language of instruction and materials: Mandarin

### Core learning concepts

- Sequence: ordering actions so characters move as expected  
- Conditional logic: reacting to events and simple choices  
- Loops: repeating patterns without copying blocks

### Motivation and rewards

- Point system:  
  - Completing a class = 1 point  
  - Earning a badge = 2 points  
  - Creating an extra project = 1 point  
- Parents define rewards that fit their family (extra iPad time, small toy, special outing), so points translate into real‑world motivation without a one‑size‑fits‑all prize list.

### Badges

- Basic badges for firsts (first class, first extra project, finishing a chapter).  
- Progress badges for consistency (for example, learning for several weeks in a row).  
- Special badges for extra effort (solving a hard bug, designing a full story, teaching someone else a concept).

The combination of projects, points, and badges helps kids see progress even if they cannot yet read a syllabus.

## 6. Parent Experience

Parents are a critical part of this product, so we designed for them as users too.

- A parent guide that explains the course goals, key concepts, and how they can encourage their child.  
- Simple checklists of skills for each unit (for example “open/close the app”, “recognise the stage”, “can run a script”).  
- A progress record and project log, so parents can see what their child has built over time and have something concrete to talk about after class.  
- Clear class information in Mandarin (schedules, dates, location, price, what to bring) in a single place.

This reduces friction at signup and helps parents feel the course is structured, not just “fun screen time”.
When kids consistently got stuck on a specific exercise, we treated it like debugging: watched the class, asked parents what they saw at home, then simplified the steps or split the activity into smaller pieces for the next cohort.


## 7. Moving Toward an Online Curriculum (In Progress)

With the classroom version validated, the current work is to turn it into an online, modular course.
Before deciding how to take the course online, we listed several options (live classes on Zoom, pre‑recorded videos, interactive platforms) and compared them by ease of implementation, required engineering effort, and suitability for 5–7 year olds.  
That led us to start with short pre‑recorded lessons plus printable badges as the MVP, instead of building a heavy custom platform first.


Key design decisions:

- Break the 16‑week structure into short, focused lessons that can be watched and completed at home.  
- Package each unit with:
  - A short video  
  - A Scratch Jr project file (`.sjr`)  
  - Guidelines for parents  
- Preserve the point and badge system in a way that parents can run themselves (for example, printable or digital badge sheets).  
- Provide simple instructions and checklists for parents so they can guide their child even without a technical background.

The goal is to keep the playful, high‑touch feeling of the original class while making it easier for families to access on their own schedule.

## 8. Outcomes and Early Signals

- Successfully ran multiple 16‑week classes with consistent attendance and high project completion rates.  
- Parents reported that the badge and points system helped kids stay motivated over the whole term.  
- The offline course now provides a tested curriculum and structure for the in‑progress online version.

## 9. Why This Matters for Product Roles

This project shows:

- Designing for a very different user group (5–7 year‑olds and their parents) compared to typical B2B data products.  
- Building an offline MVP first, learning from real classrooms, then planning how to scale it online.  
- Thinking about motivation systems, user journeys, and multi‑stakeholder needs (kids, parents, instructor) in a structured way.

It complements the InfosecDecompress podcast by showing similar product thinking—just applied to early‑childhood programming instead of adult cybersecurity.
